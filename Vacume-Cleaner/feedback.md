# Feedback for ss23.1.0.a/cu31jydy-1

**Team members:** cu31jydy-1

**Total points:** 35

**General notes:**
1. Please reach out if you think there was a mistake with the grading.
2. If the feedback below provides suggestions how your submission could be improved, this is not a request that you actually update your submission (unless stated otherwise). However, you might use some of the suggestions in future assignments.

-----------------

According to the grading script, you would get 0 points for the solution.
However, it seems that you solved `a` and `b` largely correctly and your solutions for `c` also go in the right direction (but have some more mistakes), so giving 0 points seems overly harsh.
Your solutions for the `FIND PLAN` problems are also wrong (I'm not sure why).

I see that you put effort (your code looks clean and thought-through).
Unfortunately, I can't give you more than 35 points at this point.
However, I offer that you can re-submit a solution at a later point if you want to and I would then re-grade it.
